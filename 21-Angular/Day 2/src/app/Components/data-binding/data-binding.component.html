<h3>data-binding works!</h3>

<!-- We will basically use the 2 methods of binding -->

<!-- 2 Way binding

from view to compenent ...
then displaying the value stored in the
component in the view again inside the label below-->
<input type="text" placeholder="Enter ur Last Name" [(ngModel)]="lname" />
<p>{{lname}}</p>


<!-- Event binding, when we  click we change the
value of lname in the `component` to "", which will clear it. -->
<input type="button" value="Reset"  (click)="clearInput()">
