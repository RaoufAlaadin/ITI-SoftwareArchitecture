1-  

    a- One way binding 

        i- from CS to html 

            When we use @x for a C# variable we have to display it in an html. 

        ii- from html to CS 

            When using an `Input tag` to take data from the user,
            And store it in a C# variable 

    b- Two way 

        using the following tags ==> (input,select and form)

           - CS to html      
            can display the stored value of the variables.

           - html to CS 
            can recieve a new value for that variable from the user.


2- @bind vs @bind-Value in blazor 

            @bind 
                ==> binds the value and create a default event of "oninput"

            @bind-Value doesn't create an event, 
                It will wait for you to decalare one using 
                    @bind:event = "oninput"
