task 5-1:  1- We have a single employee ( we do not need an array )

                      2- take his data from the user-input (reading data)
            ** we will input all of his data despite not needing everything for output**

                      3- print out --- Employee ID , name , net
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

task 5-2:  1- integrate employee with menu 
                      2- array of 3 employees 
                      3 - new : Enter data for 3 employees 
                            a- the screen will have all the data tags and the cursor will move
                            b- to a writing point each time you press enter 
                            c- it clears the screen afterwards and loads another form
                                to let you write the next employee's data
                                
                    4- display : this function will display the following
                                a- id
                                b- name 
                                c- net salary
                        ** idk if we should show each employee in a different screens or just one screen**
                        ** if it's just one screen, we would need to squeeze the data in coloumns**
                        
                        
                          note: What if i want to only read the data of one employee ? 
                          ---->  This is is what we need in task 5-3  !!!!!
                          
                        
                    5- exit : it's the just the same, it ends the program. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

task 5-3:  1- Array of 10 employees 
                      2- new : here it will only take one employee, 
                                you would need to press it again to enter  
                                more employees.....
                                
                                OR !! we could ask the user for the number of employees he want to enter
                                    and then view the number of the forms that he asked for, one by one. 
                                    
                        BOUNS: check if the id already have data.. 
                                and ask the user if he wants to override ??? or Enter a new index to store in. 
                                    
                                    
                     3- Display: Ask for employee's ID 
                            if ( ID == e[i].id) 
                                printf(" Emp id : ... ,Name : ... ,Net Salary);
                            else
                                printf("No data found on that id
                                       
                        I think it would  need 
                                a- for loops 
                                b- flag 
                                c- return statements as it's going to be a function.
                                d- the use of linear search. 
                        
                        ** without the use of external data structure. ****
                    
                        
                     
                     
                     4- Display all: 
                     this  function will display all the employees data, that I have entered
                     WITHOUT !!!!  displaying garbage employees !!!!
                     
                     Ex. any employee that has their data not entered will have an id of (zero). 
                                       
                    5- Delete by id 
                    
                    6- delete by name. 
                        this will use strcmp i guess. 
                        
                    7- exit. 
                     
               summary : menu + struct + functions.



typedef struct employee
{int id,age;
    char gender, name[100],address[200];
    double salary, overtime, deduct;

    // net = (salary + overtime ) - deduct.
    // we will use this formula everytime we want the net. salary !!
