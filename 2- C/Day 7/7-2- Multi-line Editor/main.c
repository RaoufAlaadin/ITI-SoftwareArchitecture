        /* task 6-3:  1- ŸêAddin a line editor to an  Array of 10 employees
                      2- new : here it will only take one employee,
                                you would need to press it again to enter
                                more employees.....

                                OR !! we could ask the user for the number of employees he want to enter
                                    and then view the number of the forms that he asked for, one by one.

                        BOUNS: check if the id already have data..
                                and ask the user if he wants to override ??? or Enter a new index to store in.


                     3- Display: Ask for employee's ID
                            if ( ID == e[i].id)
                                printf(" Emp id : ... ,Name : ... ,Net Salary);
                            else
                                printf("No data found on that id

                        I think it would  need
                                a- for loops
                                b- flag
                                c- return statements as it's going to be a function.
                                d- the use of linear search.

                        ** without the use of external data structure. ****




                     4- Display all:
                     this  function will display all the employees data, that I have entered
                     WITHOUT !!!!  displaying garbage employees !!!!

                     Ex. any employee that has their data not entered will have an id of (zero).

                    5- Delete by id

                    6- delete by name.
                        this will use strcmp i guess.

                    7- exit.

               summary : menu + struct + functions.




               While development notes:

               1-  We could have added  _getche() and press enter if you want to go back as a function
                    instead of using sleep.
